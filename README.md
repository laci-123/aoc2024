# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions for [https://adventofcode.com/2024](Advent of Code 2024). 

Each day's solutions are in a separate directory (`first.py` for the first part, `second.py` for the second part).
They read the puzzle input from standard input and print the answer to stdandard output.
